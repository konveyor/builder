# Builder
From time to time we need a newer version of Go to build projects than is available from go-toolset, or other images available on Quay or registry.access.redhat.com.

While there are usually up to date images on docker.io we tend to hit frequent issues with rate limiting when pulling from there to build on Quay.

The Dockerfiles in this repository build `quay.io/konveyor/builder` images with an up to date version of Go, and are published automatically by the GitHub Actions workflows linked above.

## Available images

| Dockerfile | Base | Description | Example tags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Dockerfile.ubi8` | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8` | Go toolchain downloaded from go.dev | `ubi8-latest`, `ubi8-v1.22`, `ubi8-v1.22.3` |
| `Dockerfile.ubi9` | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9` | Go toolchain downloaded from go.dev | `ubi9-latest`, `ubi9-v1.22`, `ubi9-v1.22.3` |
| `Dockerfile.ubi10` | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10` | Go toolchain downloaded from go.dev | `ubi10-latest`, `ubi10-v1.22`, `ubi10-v1.22.3` |
| `Dockerfile.ubi8-openssl-fips` | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8` | Go toolchain built from [golang-fips/go](https://github.com/golang-fips/go) for FIPS/OpenSSL support | `ubi8-openssl-fips-latest`, `ubi8-openssl-fips-v1.22`, `ubi8-openssl-fips-v1.22.3` |
| `Dockerfile.ubi9-openssl-fips` | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9` | Go toolchain built from [golang-fips/go](https://github.com/golang-fips/go) for FIPS/OpenSSL support | `ubi9-openssl-fips-latest`, `ubi9-openssl-fips-v1.22`, `ubi9-openssl-fips-v1.22.3` |
| `Dockerfile.ubi10-openssl-fips` | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10` | Go toolchain built from [golang-fips/go](https://github.com/golang-fips/go) for FIPS/OpenSSL support | `ubi10-openssl-fips-latest`, `ubi10-openssl-fips-v1.22`, `ubi10-openssl-fips-v1.22.3` |
| `go.dev.Dockerfile.ubi9` | `quay.io/konveyor/builder:ubi9-latest` | Installs an additional Go version via `go install golang.org/dl/goX.Y.Z` on top of the UBI 9 image | built via `workflow_dispatch` on `ubi9_multi_arch_image_build_godev.yml` |

All images are multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`) and are published to `quay.io/konveyor/builder`. Each workflow can be triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) with a specific `go_version` input, runs on a weekly schedule to pick up new Go releases, and also runs on pull requests/pushes that touch the relevant Dockerfile.
