## The maintainability rule: one owner per rule

Logic that more than one workflow needs lives in exactly one place
under `scripts/`. Workflows contain orchestration plus only the
consumption that makes them distinct — a workflow step should read
like *what it does with the data*, not *how the data is derived*. If a
change would copy a rule into a second workflow, extract the rule
instead.

Current single owners:

| Rule | Owner |
| ---- | ----- |
| Shipped-image selection — quay tags grouped by digest, per variant family the newest patch of the two newest minor versions, `-pre`-aware; per-kind published latest (`--latest-by-kind`, kind-filtered before the per-minor reduction) | `scripts/shipped-set.sh` (`--raw` emits every active tag; all modes exclude names containing `godev`) |
| Image tag naming and publishing — `<prefix>v<version>[-pre]`, `latest[<version>][-pre]` (the version segment is not hyphenated, e.g. `latest1.27.3-pre`); the fips prefix states the backend (`openssl-fips-` for Go ≤1.26, `hostfips-` for 1.27+, keyed on the golang-fips source tag); pre-release sources publish only `-pre` tags, stable only plain; tag pruning is manual (quay's management API rejects robot tokens — see image-build.yml), each build re-points the sibling generation's latest aliases and logs the tags the manual prune should remove | `.github/workflows/image-build.yml` (build-time publishing) and `.github/workflows/ubi-drift-check.yml` (drift-time re-pointing of the canonical latest aliases) — the only two workflows that write to the registry |
| Variant registry — which UBI majors and flavors ship | `variants.txt` (workflows enumerate it; adding a variant is adding a line) |
| Release-notes security context — upstream source links (go.dev, golang-fips) and the Go CVEs fixed by a version, from the OSV.dev query of the Go vulnerability database | `scripts/release-sources.sh` |
| Release-notes base diff — the RHEL/UBI CVEs fixed between the previous and current image of a family, from trivy OS-package scans of both digests | `scripts/base-cve-diff.sh` |
| CI tool image pins — syft, actionlint versions; declared in `docker-compose.yml` (bumped by Dependabot's docker-compose ecosystem, since neither the docker nor github-actions ecosystems can see `docker run` references in workflow run blocks) and read by workflows through the single lookup | `docker-compose.yml` + `scripts/tool-pins.sh` |
| README version-tracks graphic — the animated SVG (light + dark) showing the latest stable Go per source as trains over a shared version axis, older releases trailing behind each engine | `scripts/version-tracks.sh` (data from go.dev/dl and `shipped-set.sh --history`; rendered files `docs/version-tracks{,-dark}.svg`, committed by `.github/workflows/readme-tracks.yml`) |

Why this is a rule and not a preference: every copy of a rule must be
found and updated in lockstep, and copies drift. Both failure modes
have happened here — `grep -v godev` survived in one workflow after
the others moved the filter into jq, and each `-pre` tagging semantics
change had to be applied by hand to four workflows, with one
missed-application bug caught only by test harnesses.

Guidelines:

- New shared logic goes in `scripts/` as a standalone script: a header
  comment listing its consumers, its stdout format, and its flags;
  `set -euo pipefail`; it owns its own retries and fails loudly.
- A workflow's slice of shared output (the awk/python that reshapes
  it into that workflow's matrix or dispatch lines) stays in the
  workflow — that part is genuinely its own.
- When review finds the same logic in two workflows, the fix is
  extraction, not a better comment on the second copy.

## Known alert noise: base-image Python packages

The repository's Dependabot alerts are dominated by four packages that
come from the UBI base image as RPMs — `python3-urllib3`, `setuptools`,
`python3-requests`, and `python3-idna`. The SBOM catalogs their
`dist-info`/`egg-info` metadata, so Dependabot matches them as **pip**
against upstream advisory ranges (urllib3 2.x, setuptools 84.x, …) that
these RHEL streams do not ship.

Measured 2026-11-12: `dnf update` in fresh ubi8/ubi9/ubi10 images moved
10–11 packages each and changed none of the four packages' version
strings (ubi10's urllib3 moved only in its RPM release suffix). A
build-time `dnf update` therefore cannot close this version-based alert
class. That measurement says nothing about any individual CVE: RHEL's
practice is to backport fixes into the existing version, and whether a
given CVE is fixed in the installed RPM must be verified against Red
Hat's advisory status for that RPM release (the Red Hat CVE page,
`dnf updateinfo`, or OVAL) — never inferred from the version string
alone.

Drift rebuilds are not a substitute for `dnf update` either:
`ubi-drift-check.yml` reacts to base manifest digest changes, and the
Dockerfiles only `dnf install` named packages, so repository updates
that land without a refreshed base are not guaranteed to arrive through
a rebuild.

Treat an individual alert as noise only after that per-CVE check, and
make remediation decisions (including any pipeline change) from it. If
the alert volume itself ever needs to go, the real levers are removing
python3 from the images (a breaking change for consumers who run Python
scripts in them) or excluding `/usr/lib/python*/site-packages` from the
SBOM catalog — both product decisions, not bug fixes.
